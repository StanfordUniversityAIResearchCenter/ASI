"""
Conceptual Simulation of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)

This Python script models a toy ASI system featuring:
- Knowledge base that can grow.
- Reasoning via inference rules.
- Self-improvement by modifying reasoning process.
- Decision making with chain-of-thought style.
Note: This is NOT real ASI. It is a symbolic, educational model.
